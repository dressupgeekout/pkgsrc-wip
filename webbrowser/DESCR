Run the "best" available web browser from among all installed browsers
using a default list or user-provided list.  The list can be specified
via the command-line or an environment variable.  Applications that
launch a web browser as a child process can use "webbrowser" so that
they don't have to be reconfigured when you decide to switch to a
different browser.
