juniper SNMPv3 crypt

This is python library to deal with hashing (md5 or sha1) and then
encrypting SNMPv3 user profiles for Juniper devices. The hashing
follows RFC 3414 for snmpv3 profiles.  The "9" encryption function
is a port from Perl from https://metacpan.org/pod/Crypt::Juniper

The encrypt function supports a seed in order to have idempotent
encryption.
