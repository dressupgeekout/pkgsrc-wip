Contains the command-line client for Cloudflare Tunnel, a tunneling daemon
that proxies traffic from the Cloudflare network to your origins. This
daemon sits between Cloudflare network and your origin (e.g. a
webserver). Cloudflare attracts client requests and sends them to you via
this daemon, without requiring you to poke holes on your firewall --- your
origin can remain as closed as possible. Extensive documentation can be
found in the Cloudflare Tunnel section of the Cloudflare Docs. All usages
related with proxying to your origins are available under cloudflared
tunnel help.

You can also use cloudflared to access Tunnel origins (that are protected
with cloudflared tunnel) for TCP traffic at Layer 4 (i.e., not
HTTP/websocket), which is relevant for use cases such as SSH, RDP,
etc. Such usages are available under cloudflared access help.

You can instead use WARP client to access private origins behind Tunnels
for Layer 4 traffic without requiring cloudflared access commands on the
client side.
