Oatbar - standalone desktop bar that can be used with various WMs and DEs.
This bar aims to become one of the most full-featured bar available.

- Flexibility and pluggability of information sources from existing ecosystems
  - Arbitrary scripts
  - i3blocks format
  - i3status format
  - PNG image embedding that could be rendered by a source script at runtime.
- External plugins are preferred, but the most basic modules are embedded:
  EWHM, layouts, clock, etc.
- Conversion of string sources to other types (numbers, bytes, percentages)
  that could be rendered by specialize widgets
- Native Pango markup support
- Source data cleaning via regexes so inflexible source module data can be
  cleaned inside of the oatbar.
