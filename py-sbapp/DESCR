Sideband is a GUI LXMF client for Android, Linux and macOS. It allows
you to communicate with other people or LXMF-compatible systems over
Reticulum networks using LoRa, Packet Radio, WiFi, I2P, Encrypted QR
Paper Messages, or anything else Reticulum supports.

Sideband works well with the terminal-based LXMF client Nomad Network,
which allows you to easily host Propagation Nodes for your LXMF
network, and more.
