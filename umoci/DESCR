umoci modifies Open Container images.

umoci is a reference implementation of the OCI image specification and
provides users with the ability to create, manipulate, and otherwise
interact with container images. It is designed to be as small and
unopinonated as possible, so as to act as a foundation for larger
systems to be built on top of.
