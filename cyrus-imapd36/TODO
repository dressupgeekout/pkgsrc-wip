Warning: this pkg is currently under construction. I plan to keep the
pkg up to date here so that the progress is transparent. I am open to
suggestions and active support.

Done:

- Updated to 3.6 (used 3.0 pkg from wip as base)

- Performed basic testing (installation on NetBSD 10.0_BETA,
  configured a IMAP server with saslauthd ldap, created a mailbox,
  configured the mailbox and caldav calendar in Thunderbird

Next steps:

- watch log files for suspious messages, clarify

- more testing, i.e. migrate my "production" 3.0.17 install to 3.6.1 

- regenerate documentation at build time using Sphinx

Bugs:

- Kerberos support, PostgreSQL and MySQL are currently not tested
