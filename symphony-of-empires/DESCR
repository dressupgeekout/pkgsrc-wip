Symphony of empires is a free, open-source real-time grand strategy game set in
1825. It aims to emulate the politics of the Victorian Era, providing an
immersive experience managing the economic, political and military aspects of a
historical country, guiding it to domination. Additionally, it also has the
potential to be used as a game engine for other eras - it also allows for total
map overhauls which means fantasy maps can be created with the game
out-of-the-box.
