git-secret is a bash tool which stores private data inside a git repo.
git-secret encrypts files with permitted users' public keys, allowing
users you trust to access encrypted data using pgp and their secret keys.

With git-secret, changes to access rights are simplified, and
private-public key issues are handled for you.

When someone's permission is revoked, secrets do not need to be changed
with git-secret - just remove their key from the repo's keyring using
"git secret removeperson their@email.com", re-encrypt the files, and they
won't be able to decrypt secrets anymore.
If you think the user might have copied the secrets or keys when they had
access, then you should also change the secrets.
