zf is an interactive commandline fuzzy finder that prioritizes matches on
filenames. zf accepts newline separated strings on stdin and outputs the
selected line on stdout. Use with a pipe, or io redirection. See the
documentation for more details. zf is also packaged as an
allocation-free library for fuzzy filtering.
