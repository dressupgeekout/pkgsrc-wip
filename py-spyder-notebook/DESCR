Spyder plugin to use Jupyter notebooks inside Spyder.
Currently it supports basic functionality such as creating
new notebooks, opening any notebook in your filesystem and
saving notebooks at any location.

You can also use Spyder's file switcher to easily switch
between notebooks and open an IPython console connected to
the kernel of a notebook to inspect its variables in the
Variable Explorer.
