pywebview is a lightweight cross-platform wrapper around a webview
component that allows to display HTML content in its own native
GUI window. It gives you power of web technologies in your desktop
application, hiding the fact that GUI is browser based. You can
use pywebview either with a lightweight web framework like Flask
or Bottle or on its own with a two way bridge between Python and
DOM.

pywebview uses native GUI for creating a web component window:
WinForms on Windows, Cocoa on macOS and QT or GTK on Linux. If you
choose to freeze your application, pywebview does not bundle a
heavy GUI toolkit or web renderer with it keeping the executable
size small. pywebview is compatible with Python 3.
