 Announcements
 -------------

 From PROJ 9.0.0 and onwards CMake will be the only build system bundled
 with the PROJ package. As a consequence support for Autotools builds will
 stop when the 8.2 branch of PROJ reaches end of life. We encourage
 everyone to adjust their build workflows as soon as possible and report
 any discrepancies discovered between Autotools and CMake builds.

   vertical_datum tables, consequently database layout version is increased

8.0.0 Release Notes
-------------------

With the release of PROJ 8 the proj_api.h API is finally removed. See
https://proj.org/development/migration.html for more info on how to migrate
from the old to the proj.h API.

With the removal of proj_api.h it has been possible to simplify error codes
and messages given by the software. The error codes are exposed in the API.

Several improvements has been made to the command line utilities as well as
tweaks in the underlying API.

   accordingly (#2477)

 o Added proj_crs_is_derived() function to C API (#2496)
