The aim of this project is to implement a versatile high-performance
software library for phylogenetic analysis. The library should serve
as a lower-level interface of PLL (Flouri et al. 2015) and should
have the following properties:

    open source code with an appropriate open source license.
    64-bit multi-threaded design that handles very large datasets.
    easy to use and well-documented.
    SIMD implementations of time-consuming parts.
    as fast or faster likelihood computations than RAxML (Stamatakis 2014).
    fast implementation of the site repeats algorithm (Kobert 2017).
    functions for tree visualization.
    bindings for Python.
    generic and clean design.
    Linux, Mac, and Microsoft Windows compatibility.
