lpc55 provides tooling around the LPC55.

Goals

    demystify the LPC55 ROM bootloader (at least for people who know Rust), by
        modeling "protected flash" settings and other sparsely documented data
	as Rust types
        implementing its protocol, removing leftover details for older chips
        clarifying the cryptographic details
    unify
        NXP's elftosb, blhost and spsdk projects
        molejar's pyMBoot
        ergonomic corresponding TOML-based config files
    library-first (independent of CLI), and an HTTP interface
    support for non-file based signing keys (via PKCS #11 URIs)

Examples:

    lpc55 info
    lpc55 reboot

Examples from inside repository (which includes example binaries, certificates,
configurations):

    lpc55 fingerprint-certificates example-cfgs/example-cfg.toml
    lpc55 sign-fw example-cfgs/example-cfg.toml
    lpc55 assemble-sb example-cfgs/example-cfg.toml
