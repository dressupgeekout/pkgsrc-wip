Fidocrypt is a technique by which a server can store a secret in
the credential during U2F/FIDO/webauthn registration, and retrieve
it again during signin. As long as the server erases its copy of
the secret, and as long as the U2F device isn't badly designed,
the secret cannot be retrieved again except by U2F/FIDO/webauthn
signin with the device.
