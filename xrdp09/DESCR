xrdp provides a graphical login to remote machines using Microsoft
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). xrdp accepts connections from a variety of
RDP clients:

- FreeRDP
- rdesktop
- KRDC
- NeutrinoRDP
- Windows MSTSC (Microsoft Terminal Services Client, aka mstsc.exe)
- Microsoft Remote Desktop (found on Microsoft Store, which is distinct
  from MSTSC)

Many of these work on some or all of Windows, Mac OS, iOS, and/or Android.

RDP transport is encrypted using TLS by default.
