Cloud-init is the industry standard multi-distribution method for
cross-platform cloud instance initialization. It is supported across
all major public cloud providers, provisioning systems for private
cloud infrastructure, and bare-metal installations.

Cloud instances are initialized from a disk image and instance data:

  - Cloud metadata
  - User data (optional)
  - Vendor data (optional)

Cloud-init will identify the cloud it is running on during boot,
read any provided metadata from the cloud and initialize the system
accordingly. This may involve setting up network and storage devices
to configuring SSH access key and many other aspects of a system.
Later on cloud-init will also parse and process any optional user
or vendor data that was passed to the instance.
