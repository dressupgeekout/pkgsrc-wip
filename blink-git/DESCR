blink is a virtual machine that runs statically-compiled x86-64-linux
programs on different operating systems and hardware architectures.
It's designed to do the same thing as the qemu-x86_64 command,
except (a) rather than being a 4mb binary, Blink only has a ~156kb
footprint; and (b) Blink goes 2x faster than Qemu on some benchmarks
such as emulating GCC. The tradeoff is Blink doesn't have as many
features as Qemu. Blink is a great fit when you want a virtual
machine that's extremely small and runs ephemeral programs much
faster.
