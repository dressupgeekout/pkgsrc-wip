MirMake is a package of MirBSD's make(1) as well as its system makefile
includes, a few required tools, and a library containing hash functions,
strlcpy and strlcat functions, etc. for operating systems which do not
have these in libc. Tools included are: bmake (name is freely
choosable), UCB install (only on Interix/SFU), lorder, mkdep, tsort
(required by a few *.mk files), readlink (re- quired by bsd.obj.mk and
bsd.cfwrap.mk).
