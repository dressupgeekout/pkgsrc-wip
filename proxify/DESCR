proxify is a swiss army knife proxy for rapid deployments. Supports
multiple operations such as request/response dump, filtering and
manipulation via DSL language, upstream HTTP/Socks5 proxy.
Additionally, a replay utility allows to import the dumped traffic
(request/responses with correct domain name) into BurpSuite or any
other proxy by simply setting the upstream proxy to proxify.
