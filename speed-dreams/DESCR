Speed Dreams is a Motorsport Simulator featuring high-quality 3D graphics
and an accurate physics engine, all targeting maximum realism. Initially
forked from TORCS, it has now reached a clearly higher realism level in
visual and physics simulation, thanks to its active development team and
growing community. It mainly aims to implement exciting new features, cars,
tracks and AI opponents to make a more enjoyable game for the player, while
constantly pushing forward visual and physics realism. It is also intended
for any research, study or teaching activity, around physics and AI, thanks
to its GPL V2+ license, and the clear and modular architecture of its C/C++
code base.
